## About me

I am Danh, full name is Pham Huu Danh.
At the time of this project, I was a final-year Software Engineering student at Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, University of Information Technology.

## Why did I do this project?

Firstly, I had a capstone project which I need to translate a scientific paper into vietnamese. Second, I love deep learning, I want to learn more about it and apply it in real problems. Therefore I chose this paper and translate it, I want to apply it in Vietnamese Natural Language Processing.
